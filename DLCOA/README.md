| Architecture (CA) is the `What`. | Organization (CO) is the `How`. |  
| It's the functional behavior of the computer from the programmer's point of view. | It's how those architectural features are physically implemented in the hardware. |
|  It includes the instruction set, addressing modes, and data types. | It deals with how components like the CPU, memory, and I/O are connected and work together. |
